# Next.js Watch E-Commerce

This repository contains the frontend of a watch store e-commerce website, build using Next.js.

## About

This project is a sleek and modern watch e-commerce showcase built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It features a diverse range of timepieces tailored for both men and women. Users can browse through the collection, click on individual watches to view detailed information such as name, description, and explore various images in a smooth slider.

To make the browsing experience more personalized, users can add their favorite watches to a wishlist. The add and remove functionality for the wishlist is powered by React Redux, demonstrating its seamless integration with Next.js.

The primary goal of developing this project was to enhance my web development skills while delving deeper into the potential of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. As I continue refining my web development expertise, this project serves as a testament to the power and flexibility of these cutting-edge tools in creating visually appealing and quality e-commerce experiences.
